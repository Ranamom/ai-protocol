# TRON AI Project

### AI Service Payment Platform

TRON is the world's largest decentralized stablecoin network, and as an industry-leading decentralized stablecoin financial infrastructure, it will provide an AI-oriented decentralized payment framework for AI systems such as ChatGPT and OpenAI. The framework covers the smart contract system on the chain, the payment layer protocol, the underlying calling SDK, and the AI payment gateway. Using the smart contract system to store user questions and AI results on the fully decentralized file storage system BTFS to achieve fully decentralized storage and DAO governance. The payment layer protocol provides support for stable currency settlement on the chain, and the interaction layer provides users with standard settlement and API for AI services.

TRX, the base token on the TRON network, and BTT, the base token of TRONâ€™s Layer 2 chain Bittorrent-chain, will be deeply involved in governance.

This framework will realize a decentralized payment system that is secure, trustworthy, tamper-proof, anti-censorship, and capable of AI, helping people build a new decentralized, intelligent financial ecosystem.

### AI Oracle

WinkLink will integrate AI Oracle services, focusing on decision-making issues required by smart contracts on the chain. AI service providers such as ChatGPT and OpenAI can provide them with the best decision-making answers based on real-world data and intelligent analysis capabilities. Integrating AI capabilities provides a simple and effective way, and also provides a new means of profitability for AI services.

* AI has powerful self-learning, and knowledge-updating capabilities and will give more appropriate answers to the same questions, and submit new answers to the Oracle contract at any time.
* On-chain applications can obtain answers that are constantly updated and iterated by AI at any time as long as they pay a small fee.
* AI can independently choose questions that users are more interested in on the chain (such as price trends, etc.), and use its own advantages to continuously optimize the answers to provide more valuable oracle services for users on the chain.

### AI Investment

On TRON, there are DeFi ecological groups such as SUN and JST covering decentralized stablecoins, decentralized exchanges and decentralized investments. Combined with the DeFi group, relying on the powerful computing and analysis capabilities of AI, AI Investment builds investment management services for assets on the chain, intelligently deploys assets, avoids investment risks, and achieves more efficient and stable returns. Through the AI investment contract, users can enjoy intelligent asset accretion services.

* Using AI technology, investment management services can create more complex and intelligent trading algorithms, analyze market trends in real-time and discover profitable strategies in a timely manner, so as to make more informed investment decisions.
* Using AI technology, investment management services can use various types of lending platforms more efficiently. By predicting the future direction of various assets, the balance between the user's assets and liabilities can be adjusted in a timely manner, thereby reducing the risk of default and improving the utilization rate of funds.
* Using AI technology, investment management services can automatically identify potential loopholes in certain smart contracts or other security risks based on blockchain financial transactions, and avoid investment losses in a timely fashion, thereby ensuring the security of user assets.

### AIGC NFT Tokenization

NFT Market deeply supports AI generated content, provides one-click decentralized storage, NFT Tokenization, pending order and transaction services for works created by AI, and provides industry-leading artificial intelligence NFT content production, Token minting, trading and collection on TRON.

The TRON NFT generation framework will mainly include AI content generation services, AI value evaluation services and the underlying SDK. By analyzing typed textual requirements or existing NFT content, personalized NFT assets can be generated for users. AI technology can also make corresponding market value assessments on the generated NFT works, and bring users a one-stop NFT platform solution. APENFT will be deeply integrated with the NFT generation framework.
